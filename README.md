# Core-Model
LANDIS-II simulates forest succession, disturbance (including fire, wind, 
harvesting, insects), climate change, and seed dispersal across large (typically 10,000 - 20,000,000 ha) landscapes. The
LANDIS-II model provides core framework services and capabilities for the application. Extensions following prescribed design patterns interact through the core-model to simulate forest processes.

Changes to the Core-Model are governed by the [**Repository Rules**](https://sites.google.com/site/landismodel/developers/developers-blog/repositoryrulesfromthetechnicaladvisorycommittee) from the Technical Advisory Committee.

Robert Scheller is the custodian of the Core-Model.
